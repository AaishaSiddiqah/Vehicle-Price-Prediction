# Vehicle-Price-Prediction
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a vehicle based on various attributes such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more. This can assist in making informed decisions in vehicle resale, purchasing, and valuation.
